# customer_shopping_analysis
The customer shopping analysis is for the "Classification of Datasets using K-Means Clustering" project involves the application of the K-Means clustering algorithm to classify datasets into distinct clusters. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm commonly used for clustering similar data points together. This project aims to demonstrate how K-Means can be utilized for dataset classification.
K-Means Clustering
Provide a brief explanation of the K-Means clustering algorithm and its functioning. Describe how it works and its applications in general.

Data Collection
Explain the source of the datasets used in this project. Discuss any ethical considerations related to data usage and privacy.
Data Preprocessing
Outline the steps taken to preprocess the data before applying K-Means. This could include handling missing values, scaling features, or any other necessary transformations.
K-Means Algorithm
Detail the steps of the K-Means algorithm, including the initialization of centroids, assignment of data points to clusters, and the update of centroids in each iteration.
Model Evaluation
Explain how the quality of the clustering is evaluated. Metrics like the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) and silhouette score could be discussed.
Results and Visualizations
Present the results of the K-Means clustering. This could involve visualizing the clustered data points, centroids, and any relevant insights gained from the analysis.
